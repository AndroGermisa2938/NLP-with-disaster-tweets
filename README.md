# NLP with disaster tweets - Mini-project

This repository serves as a submission for the Introduction To Deep Learning course week 4 project. The prompt for the project was to participate in the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview) Kaggle challenge. The goal was to create a Neural Network for classifying text data as an introduction to Natural Language Processing.

I built two models: A simple model, and a revised architecture model which implements a LTSM layer. I compared the performance of both models, and used the one with higher accuracy to generate a submission for the challenge.

This repository contains the Jupiter Notebook with my work for the project, as well as a screenshot of the result of my submission. I will also add a link to my kaggle notebook below.
